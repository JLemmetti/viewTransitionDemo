# View Transition API Demo

This project was part of my [TampereJS](https://www.meetabit.com/communities/tamperejs) presentation held at 2025-05-22.

This project demonstrates a slide deck built with React, showcasing the use of the View Transition API available in modern browsers. The application highlights how to integrate this API into a React-based project for seamless and visually appealing transitions between slides.

## Features

- **Each slide has its own route** using TanStack Router.
- **Keyboard navigation**: Move between slides using arrow keys.
- **View Transition API**: Smooth transitions between slides and UI elements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: All styling is handled with Tailwind for rapid and consistent UI development.
- **Component-based structure**: Each component resides in its own folder for maintainability.

## Technical Stack

- [React 19 Experimental](https://react.dev/)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Folder Structure

- `src/components/` – Reusable UI components (e.g., SlideHeader, SlideList, CodeExample)
- `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks (e.g., `useSlideNavigation` for keyboard navigation)
- `src/routes/` – Each slide and route as a separate file/component
- `src/assets/` – Static assets (e.g., images)

## Routing

- Routing is handled by TanStack Router.
- Each slide is a route (see `src/routes/`).
- `routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated by TanStack Router and should not be edited manually.

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS is used for all styling.
- Utility classes are applied directly in JSX for rapid development and easy maintenance.

## Running the Project

**Warning!** This project uses experimental version of React 19 and `npm i` will probably fail. If this happens, run:

```zsh
npm uninstall react react-dom
npm i react@18 react-dom@18
npm i
npm i react@experimental react-dom@experimental
```

1. **Install dependencies:**

```zsh
npm install
```

2. **Start the development server:**

```zsh
npm run dev
```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app.
